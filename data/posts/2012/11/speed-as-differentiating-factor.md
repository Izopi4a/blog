﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Speed as differentiating factor
======================================

Optimization is based on improvements concerning network connectivity,
the web server optimization and improvement of the different elements
that have their own websites, from HTML to JavaScript, CSS or going by
the number of requests to DNS servers.

Many stories about how large Internet companies have improved their
businesses by increasing their websites performance are not so many
years ago:

-   **Amazon**: 0.1 second delay means a [loss of 1% of
    revenues](http://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/11/marissa-mayer-at-web-20.html).
-   **Google**: 0.4 second delay causes a [drop of 0.59% of
    searches](http://velocityconf.com/velocity2009/public/schedule/detail/8523)
    per user, 0.5 seconds to load involves 25% fewer searches.
-   **Google Maps**: reduced by 30% the size of their files and the
    [number of requests increased
    30%](http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9954972-7.html).
-   **Bing**: 1 second delay implies a fall of 2.8% of revenue, 2 second
    delay implies a drop of 4.3% in revenue per user
-   **Yahoo!**: 0.4 seconds of delay causes a drop [between 5% and 9% of
    the
    traffic](http://www.slideshare.net/stoyan/dont-make-me-wait-or-building-highperformance-web-applications).
-   **Mozilla**: make their download page [2.2 seconds
    faster](http://blog.mozilla.org/metrics/2010/03/31/firefox-page-load-speed-part-i/)
    and there was a growth of 15.4% downloads.

In general:

-   47% of users expect a page load in under 2 seconds.
-   14% of online stores users change if the page takes too long to
    load.
-   40% of users leave a page that takes more than 3 seconds to load
-   64% of buyers who are not satisfied are changing their website for
    their next purchase

In summary: The more performance, the better. However, creating fast
websites require optimizations in these aspects:

-   Connectivity
-   Contents
-   Cookies
-   CSS
-   Images
-   JavaScript
-   Mobile
-   Server

Large sites like Yahoo! or Google have launched various tools to check
the speed and performance of web sites, whether from their web platforms
and external applications that work in some browsers.

-   [Google
    mod\_pagespeed](http://googledevelopers.blogspot.com/2012/10/make-web-faster-with-modpagespeed-now.html):
    is a module for Apache 2 loaded with the default settings of many
    options (compression, CSS and JS group …).
-   [Google PageSpeed](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/):
    a tool to test the speed of a website from your browser
-   [Yahoo! YSlow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/): is a tool that
    can be installed in many browsers as an addon

    Google](https://developers.google.com/speed/)

In future articles we will explain how to make faster web
sites/applications using Phalcon also techniques and best practices to
improve performance in applications made with PHP.
