Moving towards Phalcon 0.5.x
============================

Our main goal is to make Phalcon a great framework that everyone can
benefit from.

With that in mind, the 0.4.x branch was a great step forward and we are
preparing for 0.5.x which will be a big redesign. The new branch will
require some refactoring which we want to discuss with you. New changes
will be introduced, big but necessary, which will affect the
functionality of current applications.

**Use of [namespaces](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php)
in class names**. This feature was built into PHP 5.3 and will allow us
to organize classes in packages.

Most of the latest generation frameworks have been or are being
rewritten to use namespaces. For example a class called today
Phalcon\_Controller\_Front would be called \\Phalcon\\Controller\\Front.

We believe that this change has to be implemented now, before the
framework grows to a point that will require a complete rewrite.

**Use of [PDO](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) for database
connections.**  Another important change is to replace the current
database adapters with PDO. This would allow us to be
[DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) (Don’t
Repeat Yourself) and maintain less code using a common interface for
different database systems. 

**HMVC**.  The last change is to implement Phalcon as a pure
[HMVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
framework. This change has taken longer than expected but is essential
for future developments as well as design.

These are the first few changes we thought of, some of them suggested by
the community. At this moment, we would like to hear your comments and
recommendations. Tell us what you think either as comments on this blog
post or by visiting our [Google
Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/phalcon)
