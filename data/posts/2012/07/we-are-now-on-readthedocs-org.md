We are now on readthedocs.org!
==============================

As we continue to enhance Phalcon with new functionality and features,
we have migrated all of our documentation on [Read the
Docs](http://readthedocs.org/), a service that hosts documentation for
open source projects such as ours.

Utilizing this service allows for:

-   Easy exporting the documentation to other formats like PDF or ePub
-   Managing the documentation for each release, independent of one
    another
-   Supporting additional languages (other than English) for the
    documentation
-   Consistency checking, ensuring that there are no broken links or
    missing images and much more.

This move required a total rewrite of the documentation, from PHP and
HTML, to [reStructuredText](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html), a format
that is independent of the code base and allows generation of the
documentation to different formats.

[Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) is not yet considered the
official documentation, since it is not complete. It does however serve
as a quick reference for development. Our goal is to have the
documentation as complete as possible prior to our next major release
0.5.x.

A new [github repository](https://github.com/phalcon/docs) has been
created to manage the documentation. Every time anyone commits a
change, [Read the Docs](http://readthedocs.org/) automatically downloads
and rebuilds the documentation, ensuring that it is up to date with the
latest developments.

What’s next?

If you have some extra time, we invite you to take a look at the [new
documentation](http://docs.phalconphp.com) and share your thoughts with
us. If you find a typo, want to improve a section, wish to see something
new that we have not covered, feel free to fork the repository and send
us the changes via pull request.

Enjoy the new documentation system!
