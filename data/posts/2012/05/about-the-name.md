About the name
==============

Some of you have asked us: Why the framework was called Phalcon?, and
we’re happy to respond.

We look ourselves as a strange kind of geek personality that make a
point to be environmentally friendly (not convinced yet being hipster),
so we love the nature stuff and as you can tell our logo obviously
represents a falcon bird! 

Coincidentally, a bird, more specifically the [Peregrine
Falcon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_Falcon), is renowned for
its speed, reaching over 322 km/h (200 mph) during its characteristic
hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the
animal kingdom!

So PHP + Falcon = Phalcon, Simple. Fast. Easy.
