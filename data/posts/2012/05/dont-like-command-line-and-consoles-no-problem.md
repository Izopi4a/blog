title: Don&rsquo;t like command line and consoles? No problem, read this story. A couple of weeks a friend from Mexico, suggested us to create an alternative interface to Phalcon Developer Tools. And.. It&rsquo;s true, some people out there argue with commands on consoles, no polemic ;).
Well, this time we&rsquo;re releasing WebTools, same Phalcon Developer tools but now with a beautiful web interface, allowing you to be more productive without extra complications.
Additional to well known commands, Web Tools provide editing facilities, so you can instantly check generated code, edit them without leave your browser!.
Paranoid Parrot Note: WebTools is optional and for security reasons it only can be accessed from localhost.
Let&rsquo;s figure out how it works with this screencast. Thanks to everyone who took the time to provide feedback. We appreciate it!
