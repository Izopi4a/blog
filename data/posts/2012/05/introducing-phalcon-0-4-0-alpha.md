Introducing: Phalcon 0.4.0 alpha
================================

We’re happy to announce that after weeks of refactoring and polishing,
0.4.x are now ready to be tested. Although, it’s an alpha release, it
has many improvements, specially focused on a more maintainable code
base and get running applications even faster.

[![image](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/real-phalcon-2.png)](http://browse.deviantart.com/#/d15brzb)

At this time, we aren’t adding new features different than 0.3.x, but we
hope to add some new components in less time than before and help
contributors to understand better the framework structure.

We want to present some new experimental features we’ve been working on.
It will not be released as part of the standard Phalcon extension until
they work properly. Moreover, you can try it and tell us the good/bad
results. Those experimental features can easily enable by activating
macros at compile time.

**Function Calls**

PHP is a very dynamic language, for example you may call out functions
in many ways giving you lots of flexibility to develop applications.
Phalcon relies on the Zend engine API to call functions on the PHP
userland. That API makes lots of validations to ensure the correct
invocation of functions at every request, at every call.

Using analysis tools like [Valgrind](http://www.valgrind.org/), we
defined scenarios to reduce the possible traces making those processes
faster. Together with the implementation of a Zend Function Cache, we’re
getting better performance results when a single function is called many
times in the same request. This feature is very useful if you’re using
Phalcon to execute long-time run processes.

**Class Entry Caching**

Another common action that PHP makes is looking up classes in the
internal class table. We’re also avoiding this look up by pointing
object constructors directly to class entry pointers that are created
when Phalcon module is initialized.

**Speed Improvement**

Version 0.4.x is 60% faster than its 0.3.x counterpart. Digging up into
Travis CI historic builds you can check out the speed running
unit-tests. From 1 min 29 secs on the build
[\#54](http://travis-ci.org/#!/phalcon/cphalcon/builds/1286939) to 51
seconds with 0.4.0 on the [last
build.](http://travis-ci.org/#!/phalcon/cphalcon/builds/1332575)
Although, speed improvement is relative, not all components will run
faster as expected. If we would make Apache benchmarks again, the
difference will not be noticeable.

As always, versions in progress are subject to change, yet require
prototype implementation and unit-testing. This is a high technical bar,
but we are in the process of meeting it in the latest Phalcon.

**TL;DR**

The new version has many nice improvements to get more speed and
performance. Also it provides experimental features to get even more
performance in the future. We’re always keen to get your feedback and
would love to hear your thoughts and suggestions regarding new features.
Feel free to send your comments to Phalcon team any time.
