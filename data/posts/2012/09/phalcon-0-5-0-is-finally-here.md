This version marks a huge step forward in our development roadmap, taking into account mostly features requested by the community and offering a lot of flexibility while still keeping performance high. Phalcon framework is now a very powerful, extensible and fast tool building any number of websites and applications using PHP.<br/><br/>The major changes in this version are:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Namespaces</strong>: Classes are now organized into namespaces. The components have been placed in their respective namespaces, offering better organization within the framework. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/api/index.html\">API Indice</a></li>\n<li><strong>Dependency Injection</strong>: The framework is equipped with the first service container and dependency injection component written in C for PHP.  All components have been adjusted to make the most of this design pattern. Thus your code becomes more extensible, testable and flexible than ever before. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/di.html\">Using Dependency Injection</a></li>\n<li><strong>Single and Multi-Module applications</strong>: The MVC components are now capable of creating single and multi module applications. This allows for easier resource sharing between modules. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/applications.html\">MVC Applications</a></li>\n<li><strong>Micro Applications</strong>: With a minimal amount of code, it is now possible to create small applications such as  prototypes, apis, RESTFul applications and more. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/micro.html\">Micro Applications</a></li>\n<li><strong>PhalconQL (PHQL)</strong>: PHQL is a high level, object oriented SQL dialect that allows to write queries using a standardized SQL-like language. PHQL is implemented as a parser (written in C) that translates syntax in that of the target RDBMS. To achieve the highest performance possible, the parser uses the same technology as <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Parser_Generator\">SQLite</a>. This technology provides a small in-memory parser with a very low memory footprint that is also thread-safe. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/phql.html\">Phalcon Query Language (PHQL)</a></li>\n<li><strong>Events Manager</strong>: With this new component you can add &ldquo;hook points&rdquo; and listen for events of the framework&rsquo;s components as well as your own. Listeners could change the normal behavior of a component or simply obtain real-time information about them. <a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/events.html\">Events Manager</a></li>\n<li><strong>CLI Applications</strong>: Now you can create command line applications.

Additionally, now, any instance of a Phalcon class offers exactly the same behavior than a PHP normal one.

Phalcon 0.5.0 is finally here!
==============================

![image](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/phalcon050-banner.jpg)

The long wait is over, Phalcon 0.5.0 final is here! This version marks a
huge step forward in our development roadmap, taking into account mostly
features requested by the community and offering a lot of flexibility
while still keeping performance high. Phalcon framework is now a very
powerful, extensible and fast tool building any number of websites and
applications using PHP.\
\
The major changes in this version are:

-   **Namespaces**: Classes are now organized into namespaces. The
    components have been placed in their respective namespaces, offering
    better organization within the framework. [API
    Indice](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/api/index.html)
-   **Dependency Injection**: The framework is equipped with the first
    service container and dependency injection component written in C
    for PHP.  All components have been adjusted to make the most of this
    design pattern. Thus your code becomes more extensible, testable and
    flexible than ever before. [Using Dependency
    Injection](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/di.html)
-   **Single and Multi-Module applications**: The MVC components are now
    capable of creating single and multi module applications. This
    allows for easier resource sharing between modules. [MVC
    Applications](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/applications.html)
-   **Micro Applications**: With a minimal amount of code, it is now
    possible to create small applications such as  prototypes, apis,
    RESTFul applications and more. [Micro
    Applications](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/micro.html)
-   **PhalconQL (PHQL)**: PHQL is a high level, object oriented SQL
    dialect that allows to write queries using a standardized SQL-like
    language. PHQL is implemented as a parser (written in C) that
    translates syntax in that of the target RDBMS. To achieve the
    highest performance possible, the parser uses the same technology as
    [SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_Parser_Generator). This
    technology provides a small in-memory parser with a very low memory
    footprint that is also thread-safe. [Phalcon Query Language
    (PHQL)](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/phql.html)
-   **Events Manager**: With this new component you can add “hook
    points” and listen for events of the framework’s components as well
    as your own. Listeners could change the normal behavior of a
    component or simply obtain real-time information about them. [Events
    Manager](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/events.html)
-   **CLI Applications**: Now you can create command line applications.
    These are useful to create cron jobs, scripts, command utilities and
    more. [Command Line
    Applications](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/cli.html)
-   **PDO Database Adapters**: All the database adapters have been
    migrated their PDO equivalents. This improves reuse of the
    framework’s code as well as offers an easier way to add more
    adapters in the future. PDO adapters increase the security of
    applications by reducing the SQL injection attacks. Also, from this
    version is available an adapter for SQLite. [Database
    Adapters](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/db.html#database-adapters)
-   **Reflection and Introspection**: Despite being written in C,
    Phalcon runs methods in the PHP userland, providing the debug
    capability that any other application or framework written in PHP
    has. Additionally, now, any instance of a Phalcon class offers
    exactly the same behavior than a PHP normal one. It’s possible to
    use the [Reflection
    API](http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.reflection.php) or simply
    print any object to show how is its internal state. [Debugging
    Applications](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/debug.html)

Other changes:

-   **URL Generation**: Now is possible to create URLs based on routes.
    [Generating URLs and
    Paths](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/url.html)
-   **Universal Class Loader**: The component to load classes is now
    PSR-0 compliant. [Universal Class
    Loader](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/loader.html)
-   **HTTP Constraints on Routes**: Routes can be set if they match on
    certain HTTP methods.
    [Routing](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/routing.html)
-   **Session Flash Messenger**: Flash messages can be directly printed
    or be stored in session to be shown in future requests [Flashing
    Messages](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/flash.html)

Alongside with the above changes, improvements have been introduced
within the framework to ensure stability and low memory usage.

**Documentation**

The documentation now provides 3 tutorials:

-   [Tutorial 1: Let’s learn by
    example](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/tutorial-invo.html)
-   [Tutorial 2: Explaining
    INVO](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/tutorial-invo.html)
-   [Tutorial 3: Creating a Simple REST
    API](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/tutorial-rest.html)

The sample applications have been updated too:

-   [INVO
    application](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/20928554661/invo-a-sample-application)
-   [PHP Alternative
    website](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/24622423072/sample-application-php-alternative-site)

As always you can download a DLL for Windows from the [download
page](http://phalconphp.com/download) and compile the extension from
[Github](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/). The complete
documentation can be found
[here](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/index.html)

We are happy to say that Phalcon is is turning into the best balance
between performance and functionality never before achieved in the PHP
world. Phalcon is one of the fastest frameworks on earth, and gradually
is being one of the most robust too, providing you the tools you need to
create amazing software and websites.
