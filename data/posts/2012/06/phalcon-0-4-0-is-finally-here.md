Phalcon 0.4.0 is finally here
=============================

We’ve been really busy this last month working on Phalcon 0.4.0, and for
our pleasure is finally here! This release is giving much more
satisfaction than ever before knowing that have been built with many
suggestions and feedback from developers around all the globe.

Also, this final version is adding some highly requested features to
Phalcon:

-   A better routing system allowing you to define custom routes
    different than /:controller/:action/:parameters
    [[idea](https://phalcon.uservoice.com/admin/forums/154026-general/suggestions/2884092-custom-routing)]
    [[more info](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/routing)]
-   A component to help you creating multilingual applications
    [[idea](http://phalcon.uservoice.com/forums/154026-general/suggestions/2766990-native-multi-language-support)]
    [[more info](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/translate)]
-   A final implementation of external template engines such as Mustache
    or Twig
    [[idea](https://phalcon.uservoice.com/forums/154026-general/suggestions/2867335-support-for-template-systems)]
    [[more info](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/views#engines)]

This time, an
[alpha](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/23111713730/introducing-phalcon-0-4-0-alpha)
and
[beta](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/23849400049/help-test-phalcon-0-4-0)
version were released before this final version to be sure that most of
changes will not affect things that already worked fine in the past.
Check out the past articles to get a complete list of changes :)\

Little by little, we try to make Phalcon increasingly competitive, but,
if you think that Phalcon is missing something, remember that
[uservoice](http://phalcon.uservoice.com/) is enabled to receive ideas
or suggestions you have, building together a new way to make the web
even faster!

As always lastest versions are available from the [download
page](http://phalconphp.com/download), we hope you’re as pleased with
these improvements as we are!

See ya!
