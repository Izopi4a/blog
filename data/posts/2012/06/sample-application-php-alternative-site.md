Sample Application: PHP Alternative site
========================================

[![Alternate
site](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/php-site-1.png)](http://php.phalconphp.com/)

Today, we’re launching another sample application for Phalcon. This
time, we wanted to create an [alternative
version](http://php.phalconphp.com/) of the [PHP site](http://php.net)
powered by the C-extension framework. This is the greatest example we
have done until now, implementing many of the main framework features,
especially the newly added: [Multilingual
Support](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/translate) and [Complex
Routing](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/routing).

You will find some of the main content such as news and some other
sections. Note, that we have no intention that this site offer the
official PHP’s content is just one example that is familiar to us all.

**Multilingual Support**

Using the translation component recently added to Phalcon, the site
offers content in [English](http://php.phalconphp.com/set-language/en)
and partially in [Spanish](http://php.phalconphp.com/set-language/es).
Anyway, for lack of time we could not perform the full translation of
the site to Spanish, although, we think this is enough sample to
understand the translation concepts. In the page footer is possible to
change the current language:

![Alternate site](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/php-site-2.png)

**Complex Routing**

Helping to improve the website
[SEO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization), we added
some routes like
[http://php.phalconphp.com/news/2012/05/php-543-and-php-5313-released](http://php.phalconphp.com/news/2012/05/php-543-and-php-5313-released),
this kind of URLs are now possible thanks to the new routing system
present in most frameworks.

If you’ve been thinking about creating a blog, or news site with
Phalcon, it is possible that this application will help you so much. The
code is available on [github](https://github.com/phalcon/php-site), feel
free to use it in your own projects and improve it (if you have some
extra time).

Enjoy!

There may be some broken links or bad translations, all is part of the
trade. :)
