Phalcon 0.4.2: Caching Views and PostgreSQL support
===================================================

Thanks for your patience, finally Phalcon supports the PostgreSQL
database system:

> PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source relational database system. It
> has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture
> that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data
> integrity, and correctness.

Well, implement a database adapter took us a lot of time! (about 2
months), but definitely not have been a waste of time. If PostgreSQL is
your favorite database you can use it now together with Phalcon!

Another important feature in this version is the ability to cache the
entire output of the Phalcon\_View. This is very useful when you develop
dynamic websites but they aren’t updated very often. (Right now the
Phalcon website is using it!) [[more
info](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/views#caching)].

If you need help implementing any of the Phalcon features (new or old),
our [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/phalcon) will
be very pleased with your presence and is always open to help you.

Check out the full
[CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/master/CHANGELOG)
for this version.

We’re a tiny core team of developers working our tails off, all the
support you can provide to the project is really appreciate. Thanks
again to all your ideas and support making this framework a reality!
