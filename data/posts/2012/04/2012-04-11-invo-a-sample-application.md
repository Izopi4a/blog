INVO: A sample application 
===========================

![Invo Application](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/invo.png)

[INVO](https://github.com/phalcon/invo) is a sample application
completely written with Phalcon. It will give you a closer insight into
application development with this framework. Although, it’s quite
functional, have some flaws we expect to complement at the future (at
this time does not produce invoices, for example).

Its user interface is written using the amazing
[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com) from Twitter. A code generator
for this framework is also available for the [Phalcon Developer
Tools](http://phalconphp.com/documentation/tools).

Thanks to bootstrap the application is fully responsive. Screens are
scaled according to a range of resolutions and devices to provide a
consistent experience, no matter what.

With INVO you can learn about:

-   Define a web site project structure with Phalcon
-   Create a basic web site layout
-   Create a “contact us” section
-   Implement a simple sign-up for the service with its related
    validations
-   Create a login form using email/username/password combinations
-   CRUD to manage companies, product types and products
-   Simple module protection, separating admin area from public area
-   Customize the framework behavior to perform better with Twitter
    Bootstrap
-   Implement dynamic navigation bars based on auth information

The application code has been shared on
[github](https://github.com/phalcon/invo). You can clone it and try on
your machine right now. Additionally, you can try it right now at this
[link](http://invo.phalconphp.com).

We expect to incrementally add inline comments to explain better how the
application works.

Feel free to use any part of the code in your applications. Send us your
comments if you find an error or have any feedback. Hopefully now, you
feel more confident creating your own Phalcon applications :)
