Phalcon 2 beta 2 available
==========================

It's been a while since we last communicated with our community. Rest
assured our resolve and determination towards the project remains the
same :)

We're in the process putting the final touches on the second major
release of Phalcon in its two years of life. Phalcon 2 is powered by
[Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com/) a brand new high-level language that
makes the development more enjoyable and easier.

Phalcon 2 now implements most of the functionality that Phalcon 1.x
offers and [it's now
passing](https://travis-ci.org/phalcon/cphalcon/builds/33532701) an
important number of tests in Travis. Yay!

### Phalcon 2 new look

We're looking for a enthusiast graphic designer/company who want to
contribute a new look for Phalcon when releasing Phalcon 2. Check [this
forum
thread](http://forum.phalconphp.com/discussion/3246/contribute-to-phalcon-s-new-look)
for more information.

### Want to contribute?

The simplest way is to look through the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/issues) for issues or
features to implement. Also fixing the necessary code to make some
unit-tests pass on Phalcon 2 would help a lot.

### Codeception

With 2.0 we are moving our whole test suite to
[Codeception](http://codeception.com/). Initial work has been done and
we will start pushing the base structure upstream while "moving"
existing tests to the new Codeception powered suite. We will need a lot
of help to get that task completed so if you want to contribute, keep an
eye out in our forum in the very near future for the relevant
announcement.

### Help with Testing

This version can be installed from the 2.0.0 branch, if you don't have
Zephir installed follow these instructions:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout 2.0.0
cd ext
sudo ./install
~~~~

If you have Zephir installed:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout 2.0.0
zephir build
~~~~

We rely on the feedback from everyone in the community to flush out bugs
and upgrade issues ahead of a big release like this. So please give
Phalcon 2 a try on your app, and if you're starting a new app today, you
should also probably try the beta2 for that, if you're just the least
bit savvy with Phalcon.
