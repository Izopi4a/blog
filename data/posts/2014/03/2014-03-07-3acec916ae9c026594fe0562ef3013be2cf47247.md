========================================

We are humans. We want to better ourselves. Taking different paths and
exploring new opportunities we all want to make the world a better place
for everyone that lives in it.

This has been the drive of many innovators throughout the years, who,
through determination and hard work, made a difference, change
minds, offering tools and ideas that make our lives easier.

Two years ago (actually our two year anniversary was in January but this
will do), a crazy idea was formed, to create the fastest and most
feature rich PHP framework as a PHP extension.

Phalcon was born.

[*3ACEC916AE9C026594FE0562EF3013BE2CF47247*](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/commit/3acec916ae9c026594fe0562ef3013be2cf47247) marks
one of the first commits made in the cphalcon repository in Github, but
in fact, one of the most significant because it declared our mission
starting that day.

Very early days back then, extremely few followers, a lot of things to
learn, many bugs and many features missing.

Since then, so many things have happened, we have been delighted to see
new contributors to our project, new testers, new users and new
applications every day.

Thank you all! Without you we could have not gone this far. 

Happy birthday Phalcon Project!
