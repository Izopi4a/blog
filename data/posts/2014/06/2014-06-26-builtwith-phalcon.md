BuiltWith Phalcon
=================

Today we are launching a new site that would help us spread the word
about Phalcon and show where Phalcon is used, whether this is production
applications, hobby projects or tutorials.

Introducing [builtwith.phalconphp.com](http://builtwith.phalconphp.com)

Taking the example from our friends at
[AngularJS](http://www.angularjs.org) we have cloned their
[repository](https://github.com/angular/builtwith.angularjs.org) and we
have Phalcon-ized it. Special thanks to the
[AngularJS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS) team as well as [Ole
Aass](https://github.com/oaass) ([website](http://oleaass.com)) who is
leading the project.

The new site has a very easy interface that users can navigate to and
even search for projects with tags. 

You can add your own project by simply cloning our
[repository](https://github.com/phalcon/builtwith) and adding your
project as well as a logo and screenshots and then issue a pull request
for it to appear in the live site.

Looking forward to seeing your projects listed up there!

\<3 The Phalcon Team
