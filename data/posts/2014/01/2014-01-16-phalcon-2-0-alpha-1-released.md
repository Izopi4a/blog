Phalcon 2.0 alpha 1 released!
=============================

![image](https://31.media.tumblr.com/ff2a4930a193909951e3200bd99a99ca/tumblr_inline_mzi9ndpeUd1qb9pu5.jpg)

We're very excited to announce the release of **Phalcon 2.0 Alpha 1**!

This release showcases yet another huge step forward in Phalcon
releases.

Unlike previous versions of Phalcon, most of this version is written in
[Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com/index.html). Zephir is a new language
that we have been developing for several months now, which is
specifically intended to ease the creation of extensions for PHP.

To demonstrate the progress we have made in this release, we are running
our official site with it. You can see
this [here](http://two.phalconphp.com/website).

### What's missing?

As any alpha version you may expect bugs and missing features, however
outreach this point is very important to us, since it allows for the
community to get involved in with it.

-   A large number of components and classes have been migrated to
    Phalcon 2 from the 1.x branches. You can see the progress
     [here](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/wiki/Progress-2.0).
-   Phalcon 1.3 has important optimizations and improvements that need
    to be migrated and integrated into Phalcon 2.
-   Phalcon 2.0 is passing a large number of unit tests. However, more
    work is needed to ensure that implemented functionality is
    compatible with 1.x prior to introducing any major changes.

### Zephir

Zephir is a high-level compiled language that we're creating to replace
development with C in most parts of Phalcon. It's fully open sourced
under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Thanks to the help and contributions from the community, we have made
huge progress in the development of this new language. To all of you
thanks!. There is still a lot of room for improvement and that is what
we hope to do in the coming months.

bugs, please (if possible) create a failing test and submit a pull
