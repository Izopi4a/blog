Happy new year and What's coming
================================

Phalcon was released more or less 2 years ago and a lot of good things
have happened. Our community is growing every day, many developers are
excited to see what Phalcon will bring us in this new year.

A great effort was made by the contributors last year to get here. To
all of you thank you very much!

As always, bring up an open-source project represents many challenges,
work and dedication. Hopefully, our plans for this year are:

-   **[Phalcon
    2.0](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/tree/2.0.0/phalcon):** Our
    next big release is the result of several months of work by the
    Phalcon Team and contributors, we still need to stabilize and fix
    some major bugs before releasing a beta version. The new code base
    is now written in a new high level language called
    [Zephir](https://github.com/phalcon/zephir) which is friendlier and
    opens a new world of possibilities for Phalcon and PHP users. 
-   **[Documentation](https://github.com/phalcon/docs):** Many new
    features were added to Phalcon in version 1.3.
    (See [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/blob/1.3.0/CHANGELOG)).
    Many of these need to be addressed in the documentation to be
    exploited better by the community. We invite you join the
    documentation teams helping out with examples and explanations and
    thereby helping to release this version as soon and better as
    possible.
-   **[Developer Tools](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools):**
    Some community members are working in a better devtools version
    including a plugin-based architecture and a more customizable
    scaffold subsystem. We hope to release this soon.

We invite you to join our team of contributors and make Phalcon a better
framework every day!

### Happy new year!

We wish a happy new year to all Phalcon users and the whole PHP
community. The Phalcon Team extend their warmest wishes to you all, and
we hope this year will bring you many new projects, challenges and
successes with PHP and Phalcon.
