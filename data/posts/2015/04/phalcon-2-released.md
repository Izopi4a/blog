Phalcon 2 released!
===================

The wait is over! Phalcon 2.0 is here!

After more than a year of development, we’re extremely excited to
announce the release of Phalcon 2.0 (final).

Those that have been following the project closely, know that this has
not been a small feat.

-   We had to create a brand new language
    [Zephir](http://www.zephir-lang.com) which allows developers to
    write PHP extensions easily.
-   We had to completely rewrite most of Phalcon 1.3.x, offering the
    same functionality as before so as to ensure that upgrading will be
    very easy.
-   Zephir had to be adjusted and enhanced as we moved through the
    rewrite, offering more functions and options to developers.
-   Additional features were implemented for 2.0, mostly thanks to our
    contributors!

The results are something that we are very proud of:

-   Phalcon 2.0, offering compatible functionality (and more) as before
-   Zephir, allowing developers to write their own extensions easily
    without the need to know C.

### Installation

This version can be installed from the master branch, if you don’t have
Zephir installed follow these instructions:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
cd ext
sudo ./install
~~~~

The standard installation method also works:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
cd build
sudo ./install
~~~~

If you have Zephir installed:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
zephir fullclean
zephir build
~~~~

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of
Phalcon installed before.

Windows DLLs are available in the [download
page](http://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows).

See the [upgrading
guide](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/115773676765/guide-upgrading-to-phalcon-2)
for more information about installing and updating to Phalcon 2.

### What’s next

Our release schedule will be every one or two months (unless we need to
issue a security fix, which will be near instant). The target will be
the most requested features by the community, although with Zephir,
contributing to Phalcon will be a breeze. We can’t wait to see those
pull requests coming in :)

Smaller changes and fixes that can be bundled in a minor version will be
released as soon as we can. We will also be working on a LTS (Long Term
Support) model for our community.

Finally we are going to start the research on PHP 7, so that we can
adjust Zephir accordingly and of course Phalcon. This task will require
a lot of preparation and work but we have our targets set on it due to
the new functionality and features it offers.

### Conclusion and acknowledgments

future. A big thank you to all the contributors and donors! We could not
