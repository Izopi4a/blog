Phalcon 2.0.2 released
======================

The development of Phalcon has been accelerated since we released 2.0.0.
More and more contributors find [Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com/) very
easy to understand and work with, and as a result it is time to release
Phalcon 2.0.2. This version includes many features, bug fixes and
improvements in terms of performance:

-   Added \`stats()\` methods to Beanstalk
-   Fixed segfault when a docblock does not have annotations \#10301
-   Fixed wrong number of parameters passed when triggering an event in
    Mvc\\Collection
-   Now Mvc\\Model checks if an attribute has a default value associated
    in the database and ignores it from the insert/update generated SQL
-   Readded Http\\Request::hasPut() (\#10283)
-   Phalcon\\Text: Added method reduceSlashes() - Reduces multiple
    slashes in a string to single slashes
-   Phalcon\\Text: Added method concat() - Concatenates strings using
    the separator only once without duplication in places concatenation
-   Added conditional on Session adapter start() to check if the session
    has already been started
-   Added status() function in Session adapter to return the status of
    the session (disabled/none/started)
-   Implementation of subqueries as expressions in PHQL
-   Performance improvements focused on PHP 5.6

### Subqueries

One of the most requested requests by the community is now available in
Phalcon 2.0.2. Now, you can take advantage of subqueries as shown below:

    $phql = "SELECT c.* FROM Shop\Cars c
    WHERE c.brandId IN (SELECT id FROM Shop\Brands)
    ORDER BY c.name";
    $cars = $this->modelsManager->executeQuery($phql);

Models must belong to the same database in order to be used as source in
a subquery.

### Default Database Values

Now in the case that a column has a â€˜defaultâ€™ value declared in the
field of the mapped table, this 'defaultâ€™ value will be used instead of
inserting 'NULLâ€™:

    $robots = new Robots();
    $robots->save(); // use all `default` values

### Update/Upgrade

This version can be installed from the master branch, if you donâ€™t have
Zephir installed follow these instructions:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
cd ext
sudo ./install
~~~~

The standard installation method also works:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
cd build
sudo ./install
~~~~

If you have Zephir installed:

~~~~ {.sh_sh .sh_sourceCode}
git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
git checkout master
zephir fullclean
zephir build
~~~~

Note that running the installation script will replace any version of
Phalcon installed before.

Windows DLLs are available in the [download
page](http://phalconphp.com/en/download/windows).

See the [upgrading
guide](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/115773676765/guide-upgrading-to-phalcon-2)
for more information about upgrading to Phalcon 2.0.x from 1.3.x.

### Comming soon

In the future 2.0.x series, we will be concentrating our efforts on
requests from the community:

-   Eager-Loading in PHQL
-   Optional string empty values in the ORM
-   PHQL custom functions
-   Case Statements in PHQL
-   Aliases for namespaces in PHQL

Later on, we will be planning the features to include in Phalcon 2.1,
for now:

-   Complete deprecation of PHP 5.3
-   Unification of Phalcon\\Mvc\\Model\\Validation and
    Phalcon\\Validation

### Thanks

Thanks to everyone involved in making this version as well to the
community for their continuous input and feedback!
