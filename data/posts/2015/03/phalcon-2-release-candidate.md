Phalcon 2 Release Candidate
===========================

Today we’re pleased to announce the first release-candidate for Phalcon
2.0. \
This release has been quite a while in the making, and includes new
features, improvements and a clean and friendly code base.

As with all pre-release packages, this is not for production use. But if
you’d like to take some of the new features for a spin, or to help find
and fix bugs (which should be reported to the issue tracker).

We’re also preparing a new website and documentation for your joy.

This version can be installed from the 2.0.0 branch, if you don’t have
[Zephir](http://zephir-lang.com/) installed follow these instructions:

    git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
    git checkout 2.0.0
    cd ext
    sudo ./install

If you have Zephir installed:

    git clone http://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon
    git checkout 2.0.0
    zephir build

It’s almost here!
