Help the community to make Phalcon available on cPanel
======================================================

In an effort to help developers with the installation of Phalcon, we
have created a feature request with [cPanel](http://cpanel.net/) so that
we can develop an installation script that would allow cPanel customers
install the extension with literally one click.\

Kindly visit the link above and upvote this feature. If we get enough
votes the feature will be included in cPanel powered hosted sites.\

Feel free to share the link with your peers and friends :)\

Thank you!
