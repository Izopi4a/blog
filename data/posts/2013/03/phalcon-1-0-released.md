very few resources, we would love to spend more resources (particularly
our time) in improving the framework and the whole ecosystem around it
(documentation, tools, support, etc).

Phalcon is an open-source project of driven by voluntary effort. We have
dedicated a great amount of our time to bring Phalcon to where it is now
and we are really satisfied and excited with the result!

We are also looking for companies/organizations/individuals who would be
interested in supporting the project financially, by sponsoring the
development and maintenance. This can be done on an ongoing donations
schedule, so we the core developers and main contributors can devote
more time and resources to the project. Due to this we have introduced
[donate links](https://phalconphp.com) to our website. If you are
interested in sponsoring us you can use the donate links on our site or
contact us directly at
[team@phalconphp.com](denied:denied:denied:denied:mail:team@phalconphp.com)
for more information.

Finally we will be setting up consulting services offered to the
community on a paid basis, so as to offset some of our costs.

### Thanks!!

Finaly we want to say a huge thanks to the community, testers,
contributors, evangelists and enthusiasts for their continuing support
and help on the project.

If you have not tried Phalcon yet, we invite you to try it now!

\< Enjoy & Have fun!\
