Phalcon 2.0 progress + benchmarks
=================================

After some weeks of hard work, long nights, burning the midnight oil (as
all programmers do), we have reached a very important milestone in our
roadmap for [Phalcon
2.0](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/tree/2.0.0).

Phalcon 2.0 will be a major upgrade as far as the internal code is
concerned and the way it operates. We managed to do this without making
big changes to the API that would break compatibility. Some minor
changes might be introduced, and if they do we will inform everyone well
in advance.

Phalcon 2.0 is currently being rewritten in
[Zephir](http://zephir-lang.tumblr.com/), a brand new high-level
programming language that is used to help us code that is much easier
maintainable than C itself and which translates its code to C
instructions.

We still have a long way to go before we release Phalcon 2.0. There are
many components and functionality that we need to migrate, address bugs,
improve functionality etc. However we are extremely excited with the
results so far.

The Zephir compiler itself still needs more work, to be able to produce
better and more efficient C directives. Much of the base code that we
have in Phalcon 1.x is also used as the base for Phalcon 2.x so the
performance of two versions is very similar. To give you an idea of the
performance of both versions, we performed some simple benchmarks
comparing these two versions, and the results are encouraging:

The basic "hello world":

This simple ["hello
world"](https://github.com/phalcon/framework-bench/tree/master/helloworld/phalcon)
application, shows an important milestone reached in Phalcon, the MVC
core functionality of Phalcon 2.0. It also demonstrates the unnoticeable
performance impact between 1.x and 2.0 due to the migration. Note that
Phalcon 2.0 is in average faster than 1.x due to the lack of
functionality implemented.

You can check the progress of migration in the
[Wiki](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon/wiki/Progress-2.0).

We're working hard to ensure that the Phalcon 2.0 launch will go
smoothly and without any problems

Can't wait to share more soon!
