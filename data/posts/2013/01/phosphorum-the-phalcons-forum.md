Phosphorum: The Phalcon's forum
===============================

[![Phalcon
Forum](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/forum.jpg)](https://forum.phalconphp.com "Phalcon Forum")

Phalcon now has a discussion [forum](https://forum.phalconphp.com)!

While there are plenty of choices on the Internet, when in need of
installing discussion forum software, we decided to roll out our own, to
showcase Phalcon and its features. We call this new forum software
Phosphorum.

Phosphorum is lightweight and simple in its design, thus it does not
implement many sophisticated features, Currently it supports

-   Registration using Github (via
    [OAuth](http://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/))
-   Create/Edit posts
-   Reply posts
-   Edit/Delete replies
-   Highlight of code snippets (php, sql, html, javascript, etc)
-   Conversion of URL links into HTML links
-   User profiles
-   User Timezones
-   User avatars via [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/)
-   Email Notifications via [AmazonSES](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/)

Phosphorum showcases some of the features that have been recently
introduced in Phalcon, specifically in version
[0.9.0](http://blog.phalconphp.com/post/41126616624/phalcon-0-9-beta-released).

You can find the source code on
[Github](https://github.com/phalcon/forum).

Phosphorum is open sourced and released under the New BSD License. Feel
free to use it, adapt it, enhance it or contribute to it with your
improvements.

Enjoy!
