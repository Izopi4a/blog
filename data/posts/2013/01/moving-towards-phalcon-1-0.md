Moving towards Phalcon 1.0
==========================

As we gradually get closer to Phalcon 1.0, we have introduced in each
version more and more features, stabilizing the framework consistently
without losing performance. Many of you have provided feedback and
requested new features that have been implemented in each release or are
soon to be implemented. Once again, a big thank you for your time and
participation.\
\
We are close to completing one year of building a PHP framework which
follows a totally different perspective, taking on the challenges of
innovation and the search for new and better ways of working and
achieving our goals.\
\
We understand there are many features suggested would add value to the
framework, so we are now prioritizing which may be more useful and
necessary in order to build a wide range of applications while
fulfilling the needs of our community.\
\
The features that we are currently focusing on are:

-   [Forms Builder/Validation
    component](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phalcon/aIgeSnOOnJc/discussion)
-   [Magic adding/getting of related
    records](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phalcon/7ws5n7uB_tE/discussion)
-   [Annotations](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phalcon/ToItuhWEcvw/discussion)
-   [Widgets](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phalcon/Kq88boXcdFw/discussion)
-   [Shadow Export of Variables to
    Views](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/phalcon/BpaZg0RFbYI/discussion)

We would like you to join the [Google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/phalcon) and give us your
opinion so as to release these features in the best possible way.\
\
Thanks in advance!
