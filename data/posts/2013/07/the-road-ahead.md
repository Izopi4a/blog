The road ahead
==============

![image](http://static.phalconphp.com/blog/img/phalcon-php-logo.png)

With every release, throughout the development of Phalcon, we have
always focused on offering a good balance between new features (driven
by the community) and bug fixes/optimizations.

Because of that, some areas of the framework have suffered, mainly unit
tests and documentation. Despite the fact that our documentation is very
thorough, there is a lot of room for improvement. The same goes with the
unit tests of course.

We have therefore decided to take a short NFR hiatus, dedicating two
stints/versions to improve on those areas that need improving. 

For the upcoming 1.3/1.4 versions, developers should expect to see:

-   Our initial attempt on addressing subqueries in PHQL. We will start
    with the \

    ```php
    WHERE (SELECT ... FROM ...)
    ```

    support for MySQL and move towards other ORMs. Once that is
    completed we will address other usages of subqueries such as \

    ```php
    SELECT x = (SELECT ... FROM ...)
    ```

    etc. This feature will span through more than one versions.

-   Go through the documents with a fine tooth comb and add numerous
    examples on every page. We will also improve on the English so that
    instructions are clear and precise. We would welcome all of you that
    contributed in translating the documentation to do just that, and
    also invite others to join that effort.
-   Enhance the unit tests of the framework. The goal is to move all
    unit tests in our latest test suite (php-tests subfolder) and
    decomission the old one. The new unit tests will be a lot more
    thorough than their predecessors, testing features in all ORMs and
    all application setups (Single/Multi module/Micro).
-   Speed up the framework. There is always room for improvement! We
    have been discussing regarding some changes in the kernel of the
    framework that would reduce processing cycles while increasing
    performance for certain tasks. Utility functions are to be revisited
    so as faster versions of them can be implemented if possible,
    squeezing even more performance from the framework.

Smaller NFRs will also be addressed during those two versions. Our
Roadmap will inform you of what is coming down the line.

Naturally, bugs will also have a high priority during those two
versions. 

A big thank you to all that have contributed, are contributing and will
contribute to Phalcon, via contributions, discussion and bug
discovery/reporting.
